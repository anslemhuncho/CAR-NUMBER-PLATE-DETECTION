# Embedded_recess

This is our group project as Group13 on the class rota
        1. Zirimabagabo Anslem
        2. Mukisa Don
        3. Arinda Johnson


Our project is mainly concerned with designing a home automated system that includes some of the following characteristics
        1. A DHT11 sensor connected to our arduino to capture the temperaure and humidity in a given area
        2. An ov7675 camera to detect motion when set on. (Usually for instances when the home owner is away to detect intruders)
        3. A piezo buzzer to go off incase the ov7675 camera detects a human being whn set.
        4. A WIFI Wi-Fi Module ESP-01 ESP8266 that helps connect our arduino to the internet so that an owner can view and control every module frpm the comfort of his smartphone.
        5. An I2C lcd screen to display the readings from the temperature and humidity.
        6. 2 LED lights to mimick security and home lighting that can be controlled by a touch of a smart button
